          <h5>ILLIKKAL KALLU</h5>
          <p>Located at a height of 6000 ft above the sea level in the Western Ghats of Kottayam, Kerala, Illikkal Kallu is a major tourist attraction and one of the most pristine spots in all of India. Situated in Moonnilavu Village, Meenachil taluk, the nearest city to the summit is Teekoy. Besides several other factors which make this peak unique, the most prominent feature is that half the boulder of the majestic rock has fallen apart. The remaining half stands sturdy and presents an extremely exalted picture</p>

          <h5>MARMARA WATERFALLS</h5>
          <p> Located at a distance of few kms from Erattupetta in Kottayam inside a private rubber estate, Marmala Waterfalls are popularly known as the ‘enchantress of the jungle’. Plummeting from a height of 200 feet, the unblemished clear waters create an aura of mist around them. The tantalising waterfalls splash into a 12 feet pond and run down to join the river Teekoy. Replete with timber trees on the green-carpeted mountains, the clear cascading waters offer a sight like no other. Slightly veiled amidst thick bushes and blue hills, the location can only be reached by a short trek on the hillside.

      <h5>ILAVEEZHAPOONCHIRA</h5>
      <p> Located at a distance of 15 kms from Thodupuzha and 60 kms from Kottayam, Elaveezha Poonchira is a small quaint hill station. Perched at a height of 3200 feet above the sea level, it can be reached by a jeep ride through the unpaved rocky mountainous terrain. Literally translating to a ‘flowery lake where no leaves fall’, the place has acres of barren land without any plantation or trees with a perennial lake ‘Poonchira’. The area receives heavy rainfall, and the entire valley turns into a river during monsoons. </p>
