    <h2>ALAPPUZHA (ALEPPEY)</h2>

   

Officially called Alappuzha, Alleppey is a city in the South Indian state of Kerala. Bordering the Laccadive Sea, it is known for its wide network of interlinking, palm-fringed canals called backwaters and rejuvenating Ayurvedic resorts. Allepey is also popular for its Houseboat cruises that pass through the serene backwaters, where you can catch glimpses of green paddy fields, choir making activities, beautiful avifauna and witness the life of locals in Kerala. 

Towards the shore lies the Alleppey beach in the Arabian Sea, a beautiful example of the gems youâ€™d find along the Malabar Coast. The appeal of this beach is only amplified by the history attached to it, and a walk down the 137-year old pier is a must. Be sure to catch a traditional snake boat race in the months of August and September and try out some toddy (palm wine) at a local toddy shop for adding a touch of authenticity to your travel experience in Allepey.

      <p> Located at a distance of 30 kms from Kochi, Andhakaranazhi Beach is an extension of the tiny village of Andhakaranazhi. The virgin beach is still noncommercialized and unexploited from tourism and a well-kept secret of the city. It is an azhy or a shoal which is a naturally formed ridge formed underwater and rises to the surface and is mostly used to regulate the inflow or outflow of water via two motor-operated shutters installed to the north and the south of the beach.
