Practised widely in India, it works on the belief that all life forms have a "dosha" - a unique mix of energies known as "vata", "pitta" and "kapha". This is similar to the Western idea of elements - water, fire, earth, and so on.</p>

Kerala cuisine offers a multitude of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry and red meat with rice a typical accompaniment. Chillies, curry leaves, coconut, mustard seeds, turmeric, tamarind, and asafoetida are all frequently used.

                Kerala is known as the "Land of Spices" because it traded spices with Europe as well as with many ancient civilizations with the oldest historical records of the Sumerians from 3000 BCE</p>

                Poovar is a small rustic town situated 27 kms from Thiruvananthapuram with unspoilt, unexplored golden sand beaches and beautiful backwaters of Kerala.
      
                Also known as a fishing village, the tranquil Poovar island lies between the Arabian Sea and the Neyyar River. Hiring a boat, (especially during the sunset)that will take you through the mangrove forest of backwaters is a must-do activity.
